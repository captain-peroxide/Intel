# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using ResNet34

This project aims to detect diabetic retinopathy in retinal images using the ResNet34 convolutional neural network architecture. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and early detection is crucial for effective treatment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset, which contains a large number of high-resolution retinal images labeled with diabetic retinopathy severity levels.
